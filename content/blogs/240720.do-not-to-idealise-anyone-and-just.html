<p>Life becomes so much simpler when we start doing this. The expectation from others doesn’t hurt you any more because you start understanding why they did what they did.</p><p>Your parents can’t provide you like your friend’s parents does to your friend.<br>Your favourite actor from your favourite show might be removed for sexual misconduct.<br>Your sibling didn’t support you even though you did the best for him/her every time.</p><p>Does that make your parents bad parents?<br>Does that make your favourite actor’s work bad in the show?<br>Does that make you start doing bad for your sibling?</p><p>The answer is NO!</p><p>All are humans and humans are highly flawed. We might be good or gifted in something but we are bad in most of the things, which we never advertise about.</p><div><hr></div><p>A lot of time, everything disappointed me how we people didn’t stand up for things we believed in. How we let fear take control of our actions. How we let trauma stop us from touching our real potential. This included me.</p><p>Soon I realised, that’s what makes humans human and why they worship gods. God represents the ideal. They are like noble gases in the period table. Everyone wanted to reach there but they can’t. There is something missing in them that they have to work towards to fix it. Many don’t even try and accept the defeat.</p><p>When we look at this way, we humans need a benchmark to touch. Without it, we are aimless arrows. God or idealism sets that aim for us. Things become easier with the aim or a goal.</p><p>It feels impossible to touch these goals. We fail a lot of times to get there, but we eventually get there. We are already living in science fiction.</p><p>If we could portray even gods failed to attain that godly status, and they were not born for it but they attained it with a lot of hard work, focus and dedication.</p><p>Then Struggles, failures and flaws would be more embraced by the society we live in than showing off wealth we owned.</p><div><hr></div><p>Thank You</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sourav_bz">Sourab Kumar</a></p>
