<p>Yes, this is the news I have been sitting on for a while now.</p><p>After my stint with jobs, I realized I need to get back into my natural habitat â€“ being an entrepreneur. <br>I want to solve some exciting problems in a field where I could be for the next 10-15 years of my life. <br>Being a product engineer in startups wasn't cutting it for me. Learning and innovations I could do were hitting the ceiling.</p><div><hr></div><h3>So, what have I built before?</h3><p><em><strong>In 2018 - Buzy Tab</strong></em>, I went around with my then co-founder (Kunal) selling digital solutions for customers to place orders from the table in the restaurant through a digital menu (very similar to <a href="https://dotpe.in/">dotPe</a> today). We were shooed away from the restaurant owners because they thought the idea was frivolous and also they didn't want to pay any money. (I was 20 back then)</p><p><em><strong>In 2019 - Hacktern</strong></em>, we attempted to build a platform that could help students get hired as interns by working on projects to show it as proof of work. This would happen offline first with 50 students, and then we would emulate the same online. Sponsors for the event pulled out last minute, and eventually, we had to cancel the event. (Have a very interesting story of my current co-founder from this stint, will share it below, read on.)</p><p><em><strong>In 2020 - Botby</strong></em>, Covid took over, my consulting gigs were off. I had enough savings to make the ends meet for the next 6-8 months. Sitting idle was getting to me, and I wanted to do something about standing in long queues for getting groceries. <br>I built a pick-up app where you could book your groceries in advance and pick them up. A couple of stores used it, but they were not willing to pay for the solution because the margins were low. I had to shut the shop because I could only pay the payment gateway fees (2%) from my own pocket for so long.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png" width="1456" height="1481" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1481,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:11971631,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e756804-46d9-43f8-9666-2c208538786b_2981x3032.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">the first store which started using botby</figcaption></figure></div><p>Meanwhile, I heard <a href="https://mydukaan.io/">Dukaan</a> raising millions of $$ even without any product or customer.

1s) of electronics.</p><p>The interesting story I spoke about during <em><strong>Hacktern</strong></em> would show you guys why I am so lucky to have her on my side in this journey.</p><blockquote><p><em> While we got to know sponsors pulled out of the event at the last minute, my last resort was to turn it into a ticketing event to cover the costs to make it happen. <br>I started running a Facebook ad for it, where we used to get close to 100 leads (their contact numbers) every day. <br>Sanjana and I called each one of them and ask them to buy the tickets. <br>We did this for 20 days straight, where we both heard 50 "NO" every single day.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ah, the resilience and the foolishness ðŸ˜… <br>On some days, she has more faith in me than I do in myself.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:16459536,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd714ab93-50ce-45bc-8e46-da24f39f9804_4031x3023.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">1 of many pages in this notebook;

There have been tons of stories in each journey I have covered and so many lessons learned, but unfortunately, it's not documented. I don't want to make this mistake again.</p></li><li><p>Want to build a world-class resilient product that can work under any conditions at scale.</p></li><li><p>It gotta be a profit-first business, once the product is perfected and tested in the Indian market. Learned this hard lesson while working in startups in the peak of a bull run and now seeing them in the peak of a bear run.</p></li><li><p>Want to traverse the journey with a lot of patience because we want to be in this field that is going to redefine human-computer interface (HCI) for the coming next 10-15 years and make a career out of it. We are just getting started now, a great time to start learning more about robots and building them.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h3>Some footnotes:</h3><ul><li><p>We have been researching the market &amp; working on the product for last couple of months now, also raising a small pre-seed round for us to get prototype out and get some initial customers to validate and test the product.</p></li><li><p>You will be seeing small demos, as we progress in this journey.</p></li><li><p>We haven't finalized on a trademark name yet - once it is finalized will share it over socials and here.</p></li><li><p>And if you're a software engineering student in your 3rd or final year, we have an internship opening for ROS developer, which can be followed with a PPO. You can drop an email with your work on <strong>hey@souravk.com</strong>.
