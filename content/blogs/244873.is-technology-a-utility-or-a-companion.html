It's always going to have some news, some message or some saucy content to bread on. </p><p>We are consuming so much information in a day, which a normal human almost 3-4 decades back consumed in his whole lifetime. I don't know if it's a boon or bane. It's very difficult to be black and white here. </p><p>We are in the process of human evolution and technology is playing a huge role in shaping the future version of humans.</p><p>By nature, we humans have been conservative in our thoughts about the Societal groups or any group we belong to. Now, this whole foundation seems to be breaking, the way things worked a couple of decades back can't work anymore. </p><p>Every goddamn person who has access to the Internet has this superpower to reach out to any person in this world. General audience and the people with the previous foundation of living is still not able to comprehend the power of this. A person who is able to crack the puzzle about what people want to see, feel and experience is going viral overnight. </p><p>There is no control over that. There is no measure of why it happened, whatever happened. General audience with any gadget connected to Internet has sort off become the victim of drug and the drug being the handcrafted Information which hits on their emotion which they don't have any control over. </p><p>All this may make you feel that technology we have has more drawbacks, it's actually not true. You're feeling this way because <em><strong>few hundreds </strong></em>of people who had/have distinguished mental discipline and higher IQ could think ahead of time and they worked on it and made accessible to the <em><strong>hundreds of millions</strong></em> of human being. Can you see the balance there? </p><p>It's not about the money, caste, creed or race anymore. The discrimination lies much deeper, the intellect. The global companies which run their whole show on this humongous network called the internet, run algorithms to find that discriminatory factor in your intellect, by getting your response to all the information it throws at you. And we feed on this like a newborn sucks on his thumb. </p><p>We felt bad when we were categorized on the caste we belonged in ancient times. But today we are categorized by a machine by the thoughts we think and the emotion we feel. </p><p>If the internet was a religion, it would be the biggest religious group in the world. And you would still belong to an <em>algorithmic</em> caste-based on your wealth, skill, influence, physical appearance.</p><p>We run towards our phone to escape the situation because the phone was not sold to us as a <strong>utility</strong> but as a <strong>companion</strong> without which we mean <em><strong>nothing</strong></em>.</p><div><hr></div><p>Thank You</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sourav_bz">Sourab Kumar</a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blogs.souravk.com/p/is-technology-a-utility-or-a-companion?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://blogs.souravk.com/p/is-technology-a-utility-or-a-companion?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blogs.souravk.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Sign up now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://blogs.souravk.com/subscribe?"><span>Sign up now</span></a></p>
