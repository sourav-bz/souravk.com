I deliberately took some time off the grid to reflect, process, and focus on personal growth in solitude.</p><p>The first week of January 2023 hit me hard. I experienced a painful breakup. Simultaneously, I had to part ways with Questbook, my full-time developer job.</p><p>In hindsight, the seeds of both my personal and professional challenges were sown at the end of 2022. Battling constant anxiety, I failed to recognise my deteriorating mental health until the entire structure of my life collapsed. This forced me to scrutinise my choices, habits, and decisions.</p><p>Fortunately, I secured another job in February, initially on a short-term contract that extended due to additional workload.<br>However, my dissatisfaction with this new position began from the start. Despite joining with the hope of making a positive impact, the toxic environment, fueled by a misalignment with the founders and the product vision, made it untenable. <br>I resigned on December 6, 2023.</p><p>Throughout this journey, I've learned numerous lessons, each deserving its own blog post. Here are few of my realisations:</p><ol><li><p>A company's culture is shaped by its founders. Trust your instincts; if you sense misalignment, don't be swayed by perks. No amount of money can compensate for the toll on mental health in a toxic environment.</p></li><li><p>You can only win big, when you're consistent.</p></li><li><p>Consistency is achievable only when your fundamentals are in order—this includes the food you eat, your physical fitness, and your emotional health.</p><p>If any of these aspects goes awry, you'll need to address it first to establish and maintain consistency.</p></li><li><p>Dream big, and avoid settling. The moment you attempt to settle, the other party may attempt to extract the most from you. When you adopt a defensive mindset, you begin to lose self-confidence, which is far more worse than losing a job.</p></li><li><p>When you're not dreaming big, every problem becomes your problem. However, when you have a larger vision for your life, only the problems that hinder that vision will truly matter.</p></li><li><p>Don't centralise your source of happiness. Seek joy in everything you do. Find a  hobby and make space to spend time with your thoughts and yourself.</p></li><li><p>Work with people who have 10-15 years vision of their own life, who have life outside work, with whom you can get on a random call to discuss life on bad days. Tech and startup bubble is lonely and very fucking delusional.</p></li><li><p>Be ambitious and yet content under your skin. Be humble, in grander scheme of the universe we are just another sand particle.</p></li><li><p>Find a hobby or a creative channel, and just do it for fun, with 0 expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Go be a student again, but this time for yourself and not for the grades.</p></li><li><p>Be in a relationship, where there is a strong sense of respect for each other. Their actions aligns with their words. They know how to manage their emotions well.</p><p>You don't have to compensate for someone's bad personality.</p></li><li><p>There's a difference between someone who can be your partner and someone with whom you can have a&nbsp; family. Choose the latter, but before that you should realise why having a good family is important.</p></li></ol><h3>What's for 2024?</h3><ol><li><p>Play more cricket, get more fitter and healthy.</p></li><li><p>Work on building a world-class product in public which is going to push my engineering boundaries and enable me to meet, learn from really smart people around the world.</p></li><li><p>Travel, explore, try good food around our country and hopefully world.</p></li></ol><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blogs.souravk.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Sourav’s Newsletter!
