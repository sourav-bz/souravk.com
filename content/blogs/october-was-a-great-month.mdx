I learned a lot, shipped the B2B [showfer.ai](http://showfer.ai/) chat widget, spoke to a couple of users, and built the [B2C version](https://x.com/sourav_bz/status/1849078040690835574) (to be released soon).

But the biggest win was the progress we made on the product we're building in the **Robotics space**.

We've been grinding hard for the past 6 months, starting with the intent to build a machine.
Failed terribly, both skill issue and the ecosystem issue.
We were punching above our weight, very intentionally (and maybe a bit delusionally).

But we truly believed â€” and still do â€” that we're nearing a plateau on the graph of human physical strength versus ambition.

It's not that we're incapable rather, humans simply aren't designed to perform repetitive, mundane tasks.
They soon lose purpose, turn towards other mediums to feel important in life.
And this is only due to resource scarcity.
We have limited resources to share, hence the incentive models are structured in ways that limit equal access to a good life for everyone.

I can say this with conviction because I've seen it firsthand: two generations of my family grinding tirelessly just to put a roof over our heads, food on the table, and pay for our educationâ€”with zero savings.
They believed that educating us was their greatest investment.
Education allowed us to glimpse a world of abundance while living in scarcity. And the internet helped us step through that gate.

I truly believe that AI + robotics will create the next wave of abundance for all of humanity.

Couple of weeks ago, we found what we wanted to build in Robotics. And it's going to be open source.
We are calling it [rigit.io](http://rigit.io/) - it's going to be a ROS IDE with embedded simulation engine working across all OS.
Those who have developed on ROS, they know how broken the whole ecosystem is. It's very high barrier for anyone to build any sorts of machine using it.
We will be solving this, with a goal that - building robots with simulation should be as low hanging as building mobile apps.

![first look of the IDE](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3a767a2a-65d3-4e84-8eaa-7a186a2ea537_5760x3304.jpeg)

This is our foot in the door to build long term in the field of Robotics and make it easier for anyone to build their own hobby or commercial robots.
If you're a ROS developer, hit me up.
I will need few design partners to help me test and shape this best for the community.

That's all folks, I am really pumped for Nov and Dec.
It's going to be most crucial and fulfilling months.
Because it's no more about answering existential questions, but more about execution and shipping, and seeing how things unfurl.

Let's end this year with a bang! ðŸ˜Œ ðŸš€
