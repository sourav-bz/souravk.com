![Life's moments](https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5823e4d9-909e-4e24-9515-3084612eb93d_4032x3024.jpeg)

There will come a phase in your life where everything will be perfect, you will thank your past for getting you here and won't worry about what the future has for you. In that moment, you will be happy and you will believe it's going to be this for very long and it will feel like this is never going to end.
There will be a few bad instances, which won't bother you because today is great and you are happy.

But life will come back to catch up, just as you start to feel comfortable and show you how illusionary things are.
Everything will change, and you will now be trained and reminded, the only thing which is constant is - **_change_**.
You will learn becoming comfortable is never an option. Even in good times, you will have an eye for the next change coming your way. Slowly you will learn to accept and adapt.

As you grow and live each day, you're getting closer to an end.
You will realize how small those moments were, how little the sweetness felt, how less you enjoyed until it lasted, and how empty you felt in your stomach even when you were full of stories.

Life is very short.
Life is very short to love someone till the end, to live all the adventures, to fulfill all your ambition, to eat all the kinds of biryani & cheesecake - and yet we choose to be oblivious and live every single day thinking we have unlimited days to do what we love & create memories with everyone you love.

Suddenly at 25, 50 seems closer than getting to 25 felt when I was 18.
Maybe this is what playing the long game means?
Maybe people played the long game because they knew how fast those years would pass by when they did what they loved and lived with someone they couldn't live without.
It felt very fleeting to them, all the big concerns of the world felt like a bleep in their timeline.

They knew what they chose and why. They were just sticking to a plan, a plan which people measured in years and they measured in what they felt in those moments.
They optimized for bliss and joy, and let life happen to them.

So yeah, just live.
Life is beautiful, you are here for a reason. In the end, it doesn't even matter, you learn, you teach, and move to the next thing and it's okay until you're enjoying it until you're learning and growing and seeing the world and the universe even bigger than before.
